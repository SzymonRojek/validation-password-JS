## Description:

---

<br>

**Project written just to develop simple pure functions and to have a better understanding of objects.**

Password Validation Form has got some restrictions:

```
- minimum one upperCase letter
- minimum one of the special characters: @#!
- minimum one number
- the elength between 5 and 12 characters
```

If the password doesn't have a one of the rule above, the error occurs on the screen.

I am checking the strength of the password and assessing whether the password is weak or good or strong enough and display information to the user. In this case I have decided to build an array with objects which contains numbers built based on the number of characters in the string, generated after submitting the form at the end:

Password is correct...

```
- "& quite good"
- "& good enough"
- "& really good"
- "& strong enough"
- "& strong"
- "& very strong"
- "& very very strong"
- "& weak"
```
